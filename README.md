# MVVM Reactive - Demo

Hi there, I'm doing this demo for fun purposes, MVVM is one of the most famous architectures out there for doing frontend development, while I have my personal POV, I thought I can do a demo application to clarify things out for new starters, and to put my opinions on the table to be more clear.

## About

The demo project contains mainly two scenes/flows, one for authentication (mock implementation only provided), and one for photo discovery from Pixabay (you can add your own access token in the environment variables).

## Usage

I'll update this once I have a ready to go demo :)

## Am I missing something?

Yes!
This demo isn't complete yet, I'm doing my best to work on it on my free time (assuming I finished other priorities on my free time), you can consider it WIP for now.

## Things Missed so far

I work on batches, with each batch adds a new functionality to multiple parts of the application, that interprets why you might see every feature/service in the project missing something :)

But to name a few important things I'm missing here and I plan to add in the future:

- I didn't consider thread safety in the API design, you'll see that a lot
- I haven't written any unit testing so far
- There are some questions that remain unanswered, things like: who does the navigation?
- No clear definition of ViewModel and it's roles, at least a definition that can fit different use cases.

## Next Steps

You can collaborate, PR, or even review, that's why it's open source (obv.), and I'm gonna be happy for that.

## Licence

Do I have to say? obv. it's MIT.
